### Rain {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### **Mean precipitation**

> Mean daily precipitation (mm/day)

<span style="color:orange">We use daily GridMet files from 2018-2020.</span>.


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/meanPPT.png")
```

#### **Snowfall Fraction**

> Fraction of precipitation falling as snow

<span style="color:orange">We use the daily GridMet files for tmin_* and tmax_* to create tavg_*. We use a temperature threshold following Keith Jenning's [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03629-7) and the data found [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c9h35). With this temperature threshold, we partition all PPT values into daily snow/rain. Total snow and precipitation are computed for each basin, and the fraction of Snow to PPT is computed. </span>

#### **Seasonality**

> Seasonality and timing of precipitation (estimated using sine curves to represent the annual temperature and preciptiation cycles, positive [negative] values indicate that precipitation peaks in summer [winter], values close to 0 indicate uniform precipitation ([eq 14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030917080900102X))

#### **High Frequency**

> Frequency of high precipitation days (≥5 times mean daily precipitation) (days/year)

#### **Green Vegitative Fraction (GVF)**

The Green Vegetative Fraction (GVF) is computed from NDVI. NDVI is taken from the MODIS Terra mission.

$GVF = \frac{NDVI_{i} - NDVI_{barren}}{ NDVI_{lc} - NDVI_{barren}}$

Where, $NDVI_{i}$ is a time varying NDVI observation (by pixel); $NDVI_{barren}$ is a global constant for barren land - here we use 0.05; and $NDVI_{lc}$ is a long term, landcover based constant for each pixel.

For us, we computed monthly GVF over the last 20 years which were reduced to month-based, pixel-wise averages from which, the maximum and maximum-minimum were computed pixel-wise. From these, a catchment mean-maximum and mean-difference were computed.</span>
