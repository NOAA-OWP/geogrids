The CAMELS data set (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies) was produced by NCAR and close collaborators and consists of two data sets: hydrometeorological time series introduced in Newman et al. (2015) and the catchment attributes introduced in Addor et al. (2017).


The LSTM model is a novel way to apply machine learning principles to hydrologic prediction. 
The attributes presenting in Addor et al. have proven useful for LSTM modeling. As part of the NextGen framework, we want to be able to test the performance of LSTM models for various catchments. 

This means we need a way to quickly produce the needed catchment attributes, for a given hydrofabric which provides an ideal use case for `geogrids` and `zonal`. Here we document the attributes and the way they are processed for a NextGen hydrofabric covering HUC-01. 

This process is being added to the `hydroresolve` workflow for creating and releasing refactored and aggregated catchment networks that conform to the HY_Features standard.

### Rain {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### **Mean precipitation**

#### **Snowfall Fraction**

> Fraction of precipitation falling as snow

<span style="color:orange">We use the daily GridMet files for tmin_* and tmax_* to create tavg_*. We use a temperature threshold following Keith Jenning's [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03629-7) and the data found [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.c9h35). With this temperature threshold, we partition all PPT values into daily snow/rain. Total snow and precipitation are computed for each basin, and the fraction of Snow to PPT is computed. </span>

#### **Green Vegitative Fraction (GVF)**

The Green Vegetative Fraction (GVF) is computed from NDVI. NDVI is taken from the MODIS Terra mission.

$GVF = \frac{NDVI_{i} - NDVI_{barren}}{ NDVI_{lc} - NDVI_{barren}}$

Where, $NDVI_{i}$ is a time varying NDVI observation (by pixel); $NDVI_{barren}$ is a global constant for barren land - here we use 0.05; and $NDVI_{lc}$ is a long term, landcover based constant for each pixel.

For us, we computed monthly GVF over the last 20 years which were reduced to month-based, pixel-wise averages from which, the maximum and maximum-minimum were computed pixel-wise. From these, a catchment mean-maximum and mean-difference were computed.</span>
